## 📥 Data Source

The dataset used in this project is a **public telecom churn dataset**, available from:

🔗 [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

It contains customer attributes like:
- Demographics
- Subscription details
- Service usage
- Monthly charges and tenure
- Whether the customer churned
